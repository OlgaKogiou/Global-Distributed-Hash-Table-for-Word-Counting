# Global-Distributed-Hash-Table-for-Word-Counting
This project implements a distributed word-counting program using MPI (Message Passing Interface), designed to process a large input file across multiple nodes. The goal is to efficiently count the frequency of words in the file, leveraging parallelism to speed up the computation.
